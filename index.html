              <h3>My first great lesson : know how to question yourself</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              The story took place when I was sixteen or seventeen years old. I
              was trained to take care about children because I needed to work
              during holidays. At the end of the first week, the woman who
              taught us wanted having an interv\ iew with each of us to debrief
              about the training.<br />Then, she received me and she blamed me
              about my behavior. I mishandled what she said. So, she explained
              me the first professional skill is the ability to question
              oneself. I didn’t \ get it immediately, but since this moment I
              really try to question myself every day in my professional life of
              course but also in my personal life too.
            </p>
            <div class="storyTitleBox">

              <h3>Organization and collaboration</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              During my experiences in an accounting firm, I had to follow
              strict rules regarding confidentiality of course, but also and
              above all regarding security, business continuity and
              collaboration. Thus, it was essential to plan a scenario daily for
              different extreme situations.<br />- My computer no longer turns
              on or when I arrive at the office, the building is destroyed (yes,
              really!). How to recover the data and how to\ be able to work as
              quickly as possible?<br />- My car has broken down and I can't get
              to work. What solutions?<br />- When I leave the office, have I
              finished my work in a way that would allow my colleagues to resume
              it peacefully if I wer\ e to die that night?
            </p>

              <h3>with the right tools, stress becomes positive</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              After 10 years of experience in business relations, I experienced
              a lot of stress and received a lot of pressure. This experience
              allowed me to develop time management and organizational
              techniques in order to reduce stress a\ s much as possible. The
              reasoning is simple: if I have time management tools and enough
              autonomy to organize my priorities, stress becomes a driving
              force. Otherwise, it is essential to communicate with your
              managers to avoid being over\ whelmed and having no control over
              the various pressures.

            </div>
            <p>
              All my life, I have always had ambitions and goals that were very
              difficult to achieve because I chose them based on my weaknesses
              and not my strengths. After 40, I finally chose to do a job that
              suits me and in which I enjoy working. The hours of coding follow
              one another like hours of leisure. I found my new puzzle and the
              possibilities are endless when viewed from the edge \ of the ocean
              that is IT development.
